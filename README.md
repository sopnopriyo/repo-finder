# React Hot Sauce App With Redux and WebPack 
This is a simple React app that I wrote that uses a Webpack environment to run. A user selects a hot sauce from a JSON data source which logs an action 'SAUCE_SELECTED' and updates the state through the Redux reducer. The info (name, maker and heat level) of the selected item is displayed below the dropdown list. A second action 'CLEAR_SAUCES' is executed and logged in the Redux store when the 'Clear All' button is pressed which clears all items from the store.

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000

```
